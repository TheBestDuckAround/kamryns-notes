# kamryns-notes
I like atomic/conceptual notes in Obsidian (I'm thinking about migrating to another solution). Here are my notes, publicized for the world to see. I used Nathan George's (KosmosisDire's) Obsidian plugin [Webpage HTML Export](obsidian://show-plugin?id=webpage-html-export) ([GitHub repo](https://github.com/KosmosisDire/obsidian-webpage-export)) to export my notes to HTML.
